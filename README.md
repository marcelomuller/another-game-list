This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

App made to keep track of beaten, 100% completed and dropped Steam games, as Steam itself doesn't really provide a great way of showing that to the user.

The goal here is to make a highly configurable list displayed in a data table and to make it the easiest to manage, just like a Google sheet with more options.
